Integrated Flow Analysis of mtD2 transfer

## Abstract
Obesity is a highly prevalent metabolic disease that increases the risk of developing many other disorders, such as type 2 diabetes. 
Although obesity is driven by many factors, such as diet and aging, emerging research indicates that immune cells in white adipose tissue 
(WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) directly regulate weight gain. Recently, we demonstrated that adipocytes transfer their mitochondria 
to macrophages in WAT, a process that is impaired in high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice and that limits the development of obesity. 
However, it remains unknown whether adipocytes transfer their mitochondria to other cell types and what factors regulate this process. 
Here, we utilize 31-color spectral flow cytometry and machine learning to comprehensively analyze all mitochondrial transfer axes from 
adipocytes to other cell lineages in WAT and BAT of adipocyte-specific mitochondria reporter (MitoFat) mice. We find that adipocytes 
transfer their mitochondria to various cell types in WAT and BAT, in particular macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, neutrophils, 
eosinophils, B cells, CD8 T cells, and some non-immune cells, establishing a network of intercellular mitochondria transfer axes that 
we define as a mitochondria transferome. The mitochondria transferome is relatively unaltered in aging-associated obesity, suggesting that 
obesity itself is not responsible for impairing mitochondria transfer, at least to macrophages. However, HFD-induced obese mice exhibited 
marked changes in the mitochondria transferome in a tissue-specific manner, with decreased mitochondria transfer from adipocytes to 
macrophages in WAT. This did not occur in mice fed a HFD containing low levels of palmitate, suggesting that dietary lipids such as palmitate 
regulate mitochondria transfer.
